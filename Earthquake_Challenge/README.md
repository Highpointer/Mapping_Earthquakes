## Mapping Earthquakes

### Map of Earthquakes in North America
![Earthquakes_North_America](static/js/Earthquakes_North_America.png)
Above is the map of earthquakes in North America. Highest concentrations are in the west coast states of the USA (CA, OR, NV, and WA), Alaska, southern Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Most of these earthquakes are near tectonic plate boundaries. There are smaller clusters in the interior of the USA (i.e. TX, OK, UT) away from the tectonic plate boundaries.
###  "Major" Earthquakes in North America

While there have been many earthquakes recorded in North America, filtering the earthquakes by selecting "major" earthquakes (mag. >= 4.5) shows that most of the earthquakes were less than 4.5 in magnitude. This map of North American shows only two "major" earthquakes, with the larger of the two (mag. 4.8) recorded in southern Mexico.
###  "Major" Earthquakes in Asia

Reviewing the map of "major" earthquakes across the whole world, it appears that the highest concentration of such earthquakes have been recorded in eastern and southeastern Asia. The strongest earthquake (mag. 6.2) was recorded in Indonesia.
