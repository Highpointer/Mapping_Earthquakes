Above is the map of earthquakes in North America. One can see many earthquakes recorded. High concentrations are in the west coast states of the USA (CA, OR, and WA), Alaska, Mexico, and Puerto. Most of these earthquakes are near the tectonic plate boundaries. There are smaller clusters in the interior of the USA (i.e. TX, OK).
