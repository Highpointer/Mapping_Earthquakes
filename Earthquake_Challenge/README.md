## Mapping Earthquakes

### Map of Earthquakes in North America
![Earthquakes_North_America](static/js/Earthquakes_North_America.png)
Above is the map of earthquakes in North America. High concentrations are in the west coast states of the USA (CA, OR, and WA), Alaska, southern Mexico, and Puerto. Most of these earthquakes are near the tectonic plate boundaries. There are smaller clusters in the interior of the USA (i.e. TX, OK, UT) away from the tectonic plate boundaries.

While there have been many earthquakes recorded in North America, filtering the earthquakes by selecting "major" earthquakes (mag. >= 4.5) shows that most of the earthquakes were less than 4.5 in magnitude. The map of North American shows only two "major" earthquakes, with the larger of the two recorded in southern Mexico.
